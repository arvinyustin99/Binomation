## Binomial Distribution Introduction

## How Binomation Works
To simulate how Binomial Distribution works, we try from numerical approach instead of formal approach. We need to randomly pick a large set of data, **M**. After generating lot of data, we generate the true/false item based on **success_rate** and the data is dispersed uniformly to ensure randomness.

After the data is ready, they are visualised into histogram with ```x-axis``` and ```y-axis``` corresponds to how many true is found in a single event, and how many events are found to be ```x-value``` respectively. The ```y-axis``` could also be interpreted as
```
How much the probability for X = x to be happened?
```

## Parameters in Binomation Model
```
success_rate  = the rate for the event to be successive, OR event to be successive from n_data
n_data        = total event to be observed
n_length      = total of sampling events to be picked
```

# Binomial Distributions Animation

Animating how the binomial distribution works

Provided with a single data, containing N items, for which every item is either **true** or **false**. This single data is generated with uniformly and with _success rate_, where success rate determine how many items in N is **true**.

And then with M data, we try to visualise the distribution of single data containing some **true** items. More data is better, for generalizing the concept of binomial distributions.

For the sake of understanding, this projects will include some animation for depicting the distributions of data when ```M = 1```, until some value

If this projects succeeded, we will try to restructure the code into class-oriented programming.
